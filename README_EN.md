# Better Wasteland


This mod aims to optimize the game, making it more comfortable and convenient for players to enjoy the entire game and fixing unreasonable aspects of the original game.

As the positioning and functionality of this mod differ from other functional mods, its main components are only Lua scripts, designed for optimization, pursuing lightness while enhancing the gaming experience. The current fixes are as follows:

Tavern UI disappearance issue: When taking a courier order in the tavern and opening the map, the tavern's UI disappears when the map is closed. (In fact, it should not disappear)

The issue of "Disable Auto-Eating" always needing to be reset: After setting auto-eating for food, when the food is used up and remade, the disable auto-eating setting needs to be reset again. (The mod will fix the eating status, so there is no need for manual settings next time)

Traveler events: After triggering a traveler event and clicking on trade, if you decide not to trade at that moment and exit, everything disappears, which is obviously unreasonable. It should return to the previous page. (The mod will record the player's choice and restart the traveler event based on the choice when exiting)

Red dot flashing issue: The game frequently triggers the red dot flashing of character skill points. The mod solves this problem in a slightly aggressive way, and most of the time, there will be no red dot flashing. (Even if there is, you can simply click on a UI to turn off the red dot flashing.)

Added Esc shortcut key function: In the game, pressing the Esc key can quickly exit the current interface. The mod will add the Esc shortcut key to most interfaces, allowing players to exit quickly without manually clicking.

Trading bug: When trading, it is possible to accidentally trade away your high-quality items (legendary items). This mod rewrites and fixes the trading logic in the original code, defaulting to trading from low-quality items to avoid being forced to trade legendary items.

This mod will continue to be updated (maintained) as the game progresses.
